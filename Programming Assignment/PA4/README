ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]
AnagramDictionary.java and Rack.java are starter files provided by Prof. Bono.
Thanks Prof. Bono for giving these two starter files for this programming assignment.

DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:
1.AnagramDictionary.java creates a anagram dictionary which is used to provide input string's anagrams.
This class uses Map data structure and ArrayList data structures.

2.Rack.java finds all possible subset of input string. ArrayList and Map data structures are used in this file.
The allSubsets method in this class uses recursion method to find all possible subset of an input string.

3. ScoreTable.java has a public function: scoreTablePrint method to print all subset of an input string and their scores.
The printing is in the order of their scores. In this class, Map and ArrayList are used. 

4. WordFinder.java provides main function of this program. It contains some IO control. For example, it reads the name of 
anagram dictionary and reads the Rack string. THe scanner is used in the program.
