*** some similarities between C++ and Java I: ***

comments are the same

rules for forming identifiers are the same

primitive types are pretty much the same (boolean --> bool in C++)

operators are the same
   (so arithmetic and boolean expressions are the same)

function definition syntax is very similar, including passing
primitive parameters by value.

control structures are the same
   (C++ doesn't have for-each; C++ allows integer-valued conditions)
