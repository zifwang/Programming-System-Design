Lab 4

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.

Question 1.1 Why can doing this save us time in the long run, over implementing the whole class at once?
    Implementing the whole class at once requires more time to debug. When we testing the whole class at once, we may encounter multiple bugs. These bugs may depend on the bugs before.
    Therefore, we have to spend more time to find each bug and its related bugs. However, testing at least one of the constructors and an accessor method at the begining, will let us 
    know, there is no bugs and initial class code. This can save us time in finding bugs in constructors. In addition, testing functions one by one would help us to locate bugs.

Question 2.1 Write down the expected results of calling minVal on each of the Nums objects that would result from the input in: nums.in, test1.in, and test2.in.
    nums.in -> -17
    test1.in -> 1
    test2.in -> -10

Question 2.2 From just looking at the results of a call to minVal, we can't always tell whether the Nums object we called it on was empty or non-empty. Write down two examples of non-empty Nums objects such that they return the same value as for an empty Nums object.
    1. one only contains Integer.MAX_VALUE value
    2. one contains two same Integer.MAX_VALUE value
