Lab 2

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.

Question1.0: Add Partners
Question1.1: import java.util.GregorianCalendar
Question1.2: GregorianCalendar someDay = new GregorianCalendar(1995,0,20)
Question1.3: System.Out.print(someDay.get(GregorianCalendar.YEAR))
             System.Out.print(someDay.get(GregorianCalendar.MONTH))
             System.Out.print(someDay.get(GregorianCalendar.DAY_OF_MONTH))
Question1.4: Calendar.MONTH return a int type. January indicates 0.
Question1.5: someDay.set(3,20)
